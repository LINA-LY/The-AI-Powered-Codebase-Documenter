# The-AI-Powered-Codebase-Documenter
An AI-powered SaaS platform that connects to a user's GitHub repository, scans the codebase, and automatically generates interactive, searchable documentation.

Our goal is a web app where you can:

  1-Enter the URL of a public GitHub repository.

  2-Click an "Analyze" button and have the backend process it.

  3-Ask a question about the code in a chat box and get an AI-generated answer.
